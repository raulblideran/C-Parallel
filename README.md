# C++-Parallel
The code above was done for an assignment for university.
It can be copied/modified without needing for refferencing.
The code generates matrices and then multiplies them. 
More instances are run in parallel in order to show the power of using multi-threaded CPUs.
Each instance of the program is on a separate thread
